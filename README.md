## ✨ Overview

**Classic Game Hub** is a stunningly designed web application that brings your childhood favorite board games into the modern era. Featuring **Tic-Tac-Toe**, **Snake & Ladders**, and **Ludo**, this hub offers a seamless **Online Multiplayer** experience alongside local PvP and PvAI modes. 

Rebuilt for **v2.0** with a "Neon Retro" aesthetic, glassmorphism UI, client-side routing, and smooth Framer Motion animations, it's designed to look as good as it plays.

## 🚀 Features

- **🎲 Three Classic Games**:
  - **Tic-Tac-Toe**: The classic strategy game.
  - **Snake & Ladders**: Race to 100 with twists and turns.
  - **Ludo**: The ultimate 4-player strategy race.
- **🌐 Real-Time Multiplayer**: Hosted on a custom Node.js/Socket.io server for lag-free online play.

High ping may cause slight delays. The default server is located in Singapore; average ping tested in India is ~50ms on WiFi. If you face high latency, try hosting the server locally.*)
